# DragonPhylogeny
This is the official repository for the Dragon Phylogeny Project: a phylogenetic exploration of dragons, dragon-kin and dragonkind, as depicted in historical works of art

# Support
This project began as a diversionary exercise at the tail end of Dr. Colautti's PhD Thesis. Following a brief resurrection for an undergraduate tutorial on phylogenies (https://colauttilab.github.io/DragonPhylogenyTutorial.html), this project has been resurrected with the help of several talented and hard-working students.

Thanks to their hard work, we have re-released a slightly modified version of the original t-shirt design: https://dragonphylogeny.threadless.com/
100% of profits from the t-shirt sales support future development of the Dragon Phylogeny project. 

**Please consider** purchasing a t-shirt or two to show your support.
