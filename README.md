# DragonPhylogeny

This is the official repository for the Dragon Phylogeny Project: a phylogenetic exploration of dragons, dragon-kin and dragonkind, as depicted in historical works of art

# Support

This project began as a diversionary exercise at the tail end of Dr. Colautti's PhD Thesis, and it now lives as as part of a suite of undergraduate tutorial for teaching data structures and phylogeny building in R (https://colauttilab.github.io/DragonPhylogenyTutorial.html). It was rescued with the help of several enthusiastic and talented students. Thanks to their hard work, we have re-released the image on a set of customizable t-shirts for purchase: 

https://dragonphylogeny.threadless.com/

100% of profits from the t-shirt support projects and grants that will help to diversify STEM research, particularly in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

Binary-coded trait matrix (NEXUS format)

## Weights

[Weights.csv](./Weights.csv)

Weightings used on trait matrix, with a brief rationale for each

## Raw Trait Matrix

[TraitMatrixRaw.csv](./TraitMatrixRaw.csv)

Trait matrix, raw data, unencoded

## Images
